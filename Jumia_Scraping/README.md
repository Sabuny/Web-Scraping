# Web Scraping using Beautiful Soup
## Overview
This project involves scraping product data from Jumia, an online shopping platform, using BeautifulSoup in Python. The goal was to extract a list of products currently offered at a discount as of 10th October 2024. The scraped data was then cleaned and analyzed, with insights derived through data visualization.
## Recommendations
This project focused on web scraping and manual categorization of products but it would have been a great opportunity to build a machine learning model to automatically classify products into categories like Gadgets, Electronics, Clothings and Footwear.The model could analyze product names and descriptions using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and provide a more automated and scalable solution for categorization. It would be grateful to collobrate on such.
