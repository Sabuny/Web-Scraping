# Market Price Analysis for Smallholder Commercial Farmers

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing market price data for Kenyan farmers' crops, extracted from the AMIS website. The platform provides live updates on crop prices from various locations across the country. As part of my journey to refine web scraping skills, I targeted specific crops from selected regions, gathered the data, and performed an in-depth analysis.

## Tools
The following tools were used for this project:
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Requests & Beautiful Soup**: For web scraping.

## Business Problem
Smallholder commercial farmers need access to live market price information for their commodities to:
- Understand seasonal and monthly price trends.
- Identify the best markets to sell their produce.
- Make informed decisions about their sales strategies.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze market price data from the past three years (October 1, 2021, to September 30, 2024) and present:
- Findings

This will help address the business challenges faced by smallholder farmers.
