### Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup
In this project, I undertook a web scraping task focused on Etsy, a global e-commerce platform renowned for its unique and creative products. Etsy offers a wide array of extraordinary items, ranging from handcrafted creations to vintage treasures. My objective was to explore the Kenyan products available on the platform as of November 27, 2024. I used Beautiful Soup for data scraping and Pandas for data manipulation.

### Recommendations
Unlike my previous Jumia project, I did not categorize the products in this analysis. However, I am open to collaboration if anyone is interested in extending the project to include product categorization or further insights. Feel free to reach out!
